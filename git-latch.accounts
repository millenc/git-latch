# Add your repos/branches and their corresponding operation IDs using the following syntax (don't include the #):
#
# repository_folder:branch:operation_id
#
# For example, if you have a repository located on the '/srv/git/my_repo' folder
# with branches 'master' (with Operation ID QJ8WFHsFcz8enMzBvyuP) and 'dev' (gHu3bpuyqLWPCQv8jB34)
# you would have to add the following 2 lines:
#
# /srv/git/my_repo:master:QJ8WFHsFcz8enMzBvyuP
# /srv/git/my_repo:dev:gHu3bpuyqLWPCQv8jB34
